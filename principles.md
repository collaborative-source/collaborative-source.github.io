title: Principles for Progressive Technology
---

*Note: This is very much a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!**

The progressive movement should be building technology that matches its needs and values, and it should be doing so in a manner that matches its needs and values. The following five principles can guide us in doing so. By following these principles, we will develop technology that is a better fit for our communities, our goals, and for the world that we want to live in.

## Principle 1: Self-Determination

The progressive movement is a coalition of people and organizations with many goals and approaches. Accordingly, progressive technology should allow for customization instead of forcing a singular "right way to do things" onto its users.

Practically, this means:

* Software should be architected for customizability and extensibility.
* Software should be licensed in such a way that communities can "fork" projects when the project is going in a direction that doesnâ€™t suit them.

## Principle 2: User-First Development

The progressive movement believes that people who are impacted by decisions should have a say how those decisions are made. Accordingly, progressive technology should include users at every phase of the development process.

Practically, this means:

* Users should be a key part of the governance of any organization responsible for developing progressive technology.
* Users should be involved in the roadmapping process for software development.
* Progressive technology projects should have clear channels for user feedback and good processes for responding to that feedback.
* Organizations should prioritize documentation and training just as highly as building technology.

## Principle 3: Accountability

The progressive movement understands that sometimes our interests may be in conflict, but believes that with accountability we can grow to trust each other, achieving more together than we could alone. Accordingly, progressive technology should be built in ways that provide transparency and accountability for stakeholders.

Practically, this means:

* Technology that is widely in use (outside of beta) should have clear release processes and be conservative about breaking changes.
* Discussions of breaking changes should be transparent and invite affected parties to give input into how to proceed.
* Organizations and individuals who have invested in a project should be a key part of the project's governance.

## Principle 4: Diversity

The progressive movement is made up of a diversity of races, genders, religions, abilities, sexual orientations, and other identities. In particular, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities drive progressive change. Accordingly, the community of progressive technologists should reflect this diversity, rather than the lack of diversity endemic to the tech industry as a whole.

Practically, this means:

* The progressive technology community should invest in work led by people underrepresented in tech, especially work led by Black, Latinx, and Indigenous individuals and organizations.
* The progressive technology community should provide technical training and mentorship for interested individuals underrepresented in tech, especially Black, Latinx and Indigenous individuals.
* Progressive technology projects and communities should have clear codes of conduct for participation with corresponding enforcement mechanisms.

## Principle 5: Deprioritizing Profit

The progressive movement believes that human rights and needs are more important than profit. Accordingly, while progressive technology should be built sustainably, it should not prioritize making money over the goals and experiences of its users.

Practically, this means:

* Organizations which are building technology should be transparent about the financial costs (and rewards) of developing technology.
* If the project is not sustainable, they should prioritize methods of accruing resources that do not involve diminishing user experience or disenfranchising stakeholder groups.
